# She Represents - Data Visualization Project

I wanted my Data Visualization project to reflect an historical year for Native American Women. Seeing women who look like me run for public office and win has been transformational. I wanted to share how important this history is, not just for Native communities, but for all communities because women have always had a seat at the table in many tribal societies. It is only now that this is beginning to be reflected on the local, state, and fedral levels. I wanted to use this project to highlight what an amazing year it has truly been for Native women. By creating a map, I hope to offer a visual for viewers to see and locate where and how  how many Native women ran for office across the country!
